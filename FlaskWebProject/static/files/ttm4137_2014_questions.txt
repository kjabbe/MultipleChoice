Resynchronization when the SQN check fails on the network side	SQN xor AK MAC S. Resynchronization when the SQN check fails on the MS side	SQN xor CK MAC S. Resynchronization when the SQN check fails on the MS side	c
How is forward key separation achieved during handovers over X2 connections in EPS	The target eNB receives a fresh key from MME immediately after handover	The target eNB receives a fresh key from MME right before handover	The source eNB sends a derived key to the target eNB by applying a one way function to the current key	Forward key separation cannot be achieved only backward key separation	a
What is the specified length of the permanent subscriber key K in EPS LTE	No standard length specified	128 bits	192 bits	256 bits	a
The end points of user data encryption in EPS are	The UICC and the eNB	The UE and the MME	The UE and the eNB	The UICC and the MME	c
The end points of signalling encryption in the EPS access stratum are	The UICC and the eNB	The UE and the eNB	The eNB and the MME	The UE and the MME	b
The end points of signalling integrity in the EPS non stratum access are	The UICC and the eNB	The UE and the eNB	The eNB and the MME	The UE and the MME	d
Does EPS provide end to end data security	No	Yes but only authenticity	Yes but only anonymity	Yes both confidentiality and authenticity	a
What is the telecom practice of lawful interception	Dragnet surveillance secretly performed by an authorized intelligence agency	Legal deep packet inspection and filtering of mobile systems traffic	Eavesdropping of private communication performed by the police	Wiretapping of private communication requested by a law enforcement agency	d
Can UMTS USIMs work in an LTE UE device	Yes because the key hierarchy is designed for this	Yes because the cryptographic keys are the same	No because the cryptographic keys must remain in the USIM	No because the LSIM and USIM are not compatible	b
Where does the key derivation function KDF of EPS reside	In the UICC and the HSS	In the UICC and the UE	In the UE and the MME	In the UE and the AuC	a
What are the three functional requirements for UMTS authentication	Confidentiality and privacy for the subscriber and mutual authentication for the service provider	AV generation at AuC key transport to the RNC and the SQN synchronization	Mutual authentication between USIM and HSS securing the radio channel communication and end to end confidentiality	Mutual authentication between USIM and AuC securing the radio channel communication and user identity confidentiality	d
Why can the UICC be physically separated from the rest of the UE device	The UE manufacturing and lifecycle can be managed independently from the personalization and subscription process	The UICC holds an expiration date and like credit cards must be replaced	The failure rate of the integrated circuit cards (UICCs) are high because the issuers(mobile operators) want to optimize cost against subscription duration	The manufacturer plugs a special key card into the UICC interface slot for key distribution and software management	a
What is the difference between a checksum code and a cryptographic message authentication code	There is no difference  they are only different terms for the same primitive	A message authentication code can be used to construct a checksum code but not the other way around	A checksum can be (re )computed by an attacker the authentication code cannot	A keyed checksum provides stronger message integrity protection than a message authentication code	c
