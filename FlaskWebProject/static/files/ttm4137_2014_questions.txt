How is forward key separation achieved during handovers over X2 connections in EPS	The target eNB receives a fresh key from MME immediately after handover	The target eNB receives a fresh key from MME right before handover	The source eNB sends a derived key to the target eNB by applying a one way function to the current key	Forward key separation cannot be achieved only backward key separation	a

Can UMTS USIMs work in an LTE UE device	Yes because the key hierarchy is designed for this	Yes because the cryptographic keys are the same	No because the cryptographic keys must remain in the USIM	No because the LSIM and USIM are not compatible	b

Why can the UICC be physically separated from the rest of the UE device	The UE manufacturing and lifecycle can be managed independently from the personalization and subscription process	The UICC holds an expiration date and like credit cards must be replaced	The failure rate of the integrated circuit cards (UICCs) are high because the issuers(mobile operators) want to optimize cost against subscription duration	The manufacturer plugs a special key card into the UICC interface slot for key distribution and software management	a
What is the difference between a checksum code and a cryptographic message authentication code	There is no difference  they are only different terms for the same primitive	A message authentication code can be used to construct a checksum code but not the other way around	A checksum can be (re )computed by an attacker the authentication code cannot	A keyed checksum provides stronger message integrity protection than a message authentication code	c
