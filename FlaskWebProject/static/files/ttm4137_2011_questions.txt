How is the subscriber identity protected from the radio channel evesdropping in UTMS?:	By keeping the subscriber identity in the USIM only.	By stroing the 128-bit secret key (K_imsi) in the USIM, and distribute only to trusted VLRs.	By using the IEMI instead of the IMSI.

What happens if the result of the UTRAN cryptoalgorithm negotiation is that user equpment (UE) and the network do not have a common encryption algorithm?: UTRAN provides a new encryption algorithm as an app download.	The connection is shut downn immediately by UTRAN.	UTRAN does not use encryption algorithm negotiation.	UTRAN may establish the connection without encryption
In which mode oof operation is KASUMI used for constructing the 3GPP f8 key stream generator?:	Combining Counter Mode and ECB-mode.	Combining Counter Mode and CCM-mode.	Combining Counter Mode and CBC-mode.	Combining Counter Mode and OFB-mode
WHat was the underlying assumtion for the MILENAGE security analysis?:	No assumtions were made.	AES must be used as the kernel function.	The kernel function must be a one-way function.	The kernel function must be a secure block cipher
Why can the USIM be physically removed from the rest of the UE?:	The failiure rate of the integrated of the integrated curcuit cards (UICCs) are high because the issuers (mobile operators) want to reduce the cost for short subscription duration.	End-to-end YTMS key-card may be plugged into the USIM slot for the key distribution and management.	The USIM holds an expiration date and, like credit cards, must be replaced.	The UC manufacturing and lifecycle can be  managed independantly from the personalization and subscription process

Does LTE/EPS provide end-to-end data security?:	Yes, but only authenticity.	Yes, but only anonymity.	Yes, both confidentiality and authenticity.	No
Can 3G USIM work in an LTE UE handset?:	No, beacause the cryptkeys must be kept in the USIM.	No, because the cryptkeys are not compatible.	Yes, because the crytpkeys are the same in both systems.	Yes, because the USIM cryptkey output is the same in the to systems
