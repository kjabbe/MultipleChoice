Why is it not sufficient to construct a one-way function y = f(x) based on an NP-hard problem:	The one-way property requires that the problem is NP-complete and not just NP-hard.	NP-hardness guarantees only that there exists a y for which x is hard to compute.	A one-way function must satisfy the property of collision-resistance too.	Computing a preimage must be hard in the worst case.	b
