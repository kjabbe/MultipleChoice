Is the same key used for both authentication and encryption in WEP?	Yes, if 802.1X authentication is not used	The same key is never used twice	No 	Yes	d
What is the major weakness in WEP, exploited by the PTW attack used in the lab?	Too short IV	No protection against message replay	The integrity check value	The IV is part of key stream	b
