What are the purposes of the UMTS MILENAGE functions:	Message encryption and authentication.	Message encryption and session key generation.	Message and user authentication/confirmation, and session key generation.	Message authentication and session key generation.	c
What is the output of the UMTS f9 algorithm:	It is a 32-bit MAC.	It is an indefinite length keystream.	It is a 64-bit block ciphertext.	It is a 32-bit authenticated ciphertext.	a
What are the consequences of the Zhang and Fang redirection attack against UMTS authentication:	Because serving networks are not authenticated in UMTS, and attacker can redirect traffic via servers abroad, causing roaming fees.	Because serving networks are not authenticated in UMTS, an attacker can learn the session keys.	Because core networks are not authenticated in UMTS, an attacker can redirect the traffic to an authentication center abroad, causing roaming fees.	Because core networks are not authenticated in UMTS, an attacker can learn the session keys.	a
Is the UMTS/LTE network domain security specifications for the core network sufficient to protect the authentication and key agreement messages against parallel session attacks:	No, the network domain does not necessarily protect the session identifier, but this cannot be exploited by an attacker.	No, the network domain security does not neccessarily protect the session identifier and may allow session-mixup attacks.	Yes, the network domain specification demands the use if IPsec of MAPsec, and therefore the core network communication is protected.	Yes, but the core network communication is always assumed to be secure, independent of the network domain security specifications.	b
How is forward key separation achieved during handovers over X2 connections in EPS:	The target eNB gets a fresh key from MME immediately after handover.	The target eNB gets a fresh key from MME right before handover.	The source eNB proides a key KeNB to the target eNB by applying a one-way function to the old key.	Forward key separation is not achieved only backward key separation.	a
Which attacks are prevented if an RFID reader authenticates to a tag:	For instance, tracking of the tag.	For instance, distance measuring and tag blocking.	For instance, tag inbentory registration.	For instance, illicit reading, cloning and reprogramming of the tag	d
How does the anti-counterfeiting measure "track and trace" for low cost RFID tags work:	By reading tags regularly with centralized storage for date and location, then a tag is "genuine" if it has a valid item history.	By using a challenge and response protocol, where the tag must answer challenge by the reader.	By using a privacy-preserving identification protocol.	By observing the unique communication fingerprint of a tag.	a

What is the vulnerability of captive pages	The weak encryption can easily be broken	There is encryption but no integrity protection.	There is integrity protection but no encryption.	Session can be hijacked.	d
What is the problem with MAC Sequence Number Analysis in Intrusion Detection Systems:	The MAC Sequence Number Analysis does not work at all because the sequence numbers are not integrity protected.	The MAC Sequence Numbers only protect against message replay attacks, but not against session hijacking.	Each class in QoS (WMM) has its own sequence number. Also an attacker can still hijack a session when the victim goes offline.	Implementatinos very often use a constant value as MAC Sequence Number, and, therefore, this does not even protect against replay attacks.	c
What is the difference between a checksum code and a chryptographic message authentication code:	There is no difference, they are only different terms for the same primitive.	A message authentication code can be used to construct a checksum, but not the other way around.	A checksum can be (re-)computed by an attacker, the authentication code cannot.	A keyed checksum provides stronger message integrity protection than a message authentication code.	c
Why is it not sufficient to construct a one-way function y = f(x) based on an NP-hard problem:	The one-way property requires that the problem is NP-complete and not just NP-hard.	NP-hardness guarantees only that there exists a y for which x is hard to compute.	A one-way function must satisfy the property of collision-resistance too.	Computing a preimage must be hard in the worst case.	bWhich one of the following security goals were present for the WEP design:	To be equivalent to the Kerberos access policy.	To be equivalent to wired access point security.	To be equivalent to wide ethernet protocol.	To be equivalent to wireless entity policy.	b
