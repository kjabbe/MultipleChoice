Why is the UICC normally easily removable from the mobile station?	The USIM holds an expiration date and, like credit cards, must be replaced	The failure rate of the integrated circuit cards (UICCs) are high because the issuers (mobile operators) want to optimize cost against subscription duration	End-to-end UMTS key-card plugs into the USIM slot for key-distribution and management	The UE manufacturing and lifecycle can be managed independently from the personalization and subscription process	d
Why must the USIM implementation be tamper-proof?	To facilitate the mobile operator with secure computation and stroage at the UE side	To protect the proprietary crypto-algorithms of the mobile operator	To protect the subscriber against unauthorized modification of the subscription parameters	To provide the subscriber with a PIN-protected access to the UMTS service	a
