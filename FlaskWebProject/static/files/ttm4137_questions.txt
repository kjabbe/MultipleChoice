What is the main trick of the Beck & Tews chopchop-like attack on TKIP? %% An attacker can avoid the re-keying interval of the MIC failure report frame %% An attacker can get responses to packets sent with partly guessed content %% An attacker can cause packets to be silently dropped %% An attacker can decrypt the special packets received over QoS channels
What are the fields of the 128-bit start value for RSN CCMP encryption? %% 8-bit flag 104-bit nonce and a 16-bit counter where the nonce field contains an 8-bit priority value the 48-bit source address and the 48-bit packet number %% 16-bit flag 104-bit nonce and a 8-bit counter where the nonce field contains an 8-bit priority value the 48-bit source address and the 48-bit packet number %% The 16-bit packet number and a 112-bit nonce value from a sequence counter %% 128-bit random nonce value 
What is Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)? %% EAP is a set of encapsulation messages for mutual authentication methods %% EAP is a set of encapsulation messages for upper-layer authentication methods %% EAP is a set of encapsulation messages for RSN authentication methods %% EAP is a set of encapsulation messages for RADIUS server authentication methods
What are the inputs of the GSM authentication function A3? %% Ki and RAND and XRES %% RAND and XRES %% Ki and XRES %% Ki and RAND
What is the purpose of the sequence number (SQN) used in UMTS? %% Preventing man-in-the-middle attacks %% Preventing session hijacking %% Preventing replay attacks %% Enabling re-synchronization
Is mutual authentication provided when a GSM SIM is used to access a UTRAN? %% Yes between the MS and the RNC %% Yes between the MS and the core network but not the RNC %% No the GSM SIM cannot authenticate the base station %% No the GSM SIM cannot connect to a UTRAN
What is the content and use of the UMTS AUTS parameter? %% SQN ⊕ AK MAC-S. Resynchronization when the SQN check fails on the network side %% SQN ⊕ CK MAC-S. Resynchronization when the SQN check fails on the network side %% SQN ⊕ AK MAC-S. Resynchronization when the SQN check fails on the MS side %% SQN ⊕ CK MAC-S. Resynchronization when the SQN check fails on the MS side
How is forward key separation achieved during handovers over X2 connections in EPS? %% The target eNB receives a fresh key from MME immediately after handover %% The target eNB receives a fresh key from MME right before handover %% The source eNB sends a derived key to the target eNB by applying a one-way function to the current key %% Forward key separation cannot be achieved only backward key separation
What is the specified length of the permanent subscriber key K in EPS/LTE? %% No standard length specified %% 128 bits %% 192 bits %% 256 bits
The end points of user data encryption in EPS are %% The UICC and the eNB %% The UE and the MME %% The UE and the eNB %% The UICC and the MME
The end points of signalling encryption in the EPS access stratum are %% The UICC and the eNB %% The UE and the eNB %% The eNB and the MME %% The UE and the MME
The end points of signalling integrity in the EPS non-stratum access are %% The UICC and the eNB %% The UE and the eNB %% The eNB and the MME %% The UE and the MME
Does EPS provide end-to-end data security? %% No %% Yes but only authenticity %% Yes but only anonymity %% Yes both confidentiality and authenticity
What is the telecom practice of lawful interception? %% Dragnet surveillance secretly performed by an authorized intelligence agency %% Legal deep packet inspection and filtering of mobile systems traffic %% Eavesdropping of private communication performed by the police %% Wiretapping of private communication requested by a law enforcement agency
Can UMTS USIMs work in an LTE UE device? %% Yes because the key hierarchy is designed for this %% Yes because the cryptographic keys are the same %% No because the cryptographic keys must remain in the USIM %% No because the LSIM and USIM are not compatible
Where does the key derivation function KDF of EPS reside? %% In the UICC and the HSS %% In the UICC and the UE %% In the UE and the MME %% In the UE and the AuC
What are the three functional requirements for UMTS authentication? %% Confidentiality and privacy for the subscriber and mutual authentication for the service provider %% AV generation at AuC key transport to the RNC and the SQN synchronization %% Mutual authentication between USIM and HSS securing the radio channel communication and end-to-end confidentiality %% Mutual authentication between USIM and AuC securing the radio channel communication and user identity confidentiality
Why can the UICC be physically separated from the rest of the UE device? %% The UE manufacturing and lifecycle can be managed independently from the personalization and subscription process %% The UICC holds an expiration date and like credit cards must be replaced %% The failure rate of the integrated circuit cards (UICCs) are high because the issuers(mobile operators) want to optimize cost against subscription duration %% The manufacturer plugs a special key-card into the UICC interface slot for key distribution and software management
What is the difference between a checksum code and a cryptographic message authentication code? %% There is no difference  they are only different terms for the same primitive %% A message authentication code can be used to construct a checksum code but not the other way around %% A checksum can be (re-)computed by an attacker the authentication code cannot %% A keyed checksum provides stronger message integrity protection than a message authentication code
