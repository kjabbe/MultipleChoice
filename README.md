# Multiple Choice "Engine"

Tool to practice on multiple choice questions, scalable on both number of questions and courses/themes.  

Provide questions in the static/files folder, add name to the list of courses/themes in the home view.
At the moment support for questions with 4 answers and one correct, hopefully dynamic ranges shortly      
Questions file should be a tabseparated txt file and have the following format:  
QUESTION | ANSWER_A | ANSWER_B | ANSWER_C | ANSWER_D | CORRECT (a, b, c or d)  

Written using the python Flask framework. Initial project template gotten from the Microsofts Azure platform.
